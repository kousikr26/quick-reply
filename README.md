# quick-reply


Web Whatsapp has no default shortcuts for replying to messages and using the mouse is too much of a pain

This extension repurposes keyboard shortcuts for easy reply functionality

### Default : 
 - **Alt + Q** to reply to a received message (Pressing repeatedly cycles through previous messages in the stack)

 - **Alt + W** to reply to your own message (Pressing repeatedly cycles through previous messages in the stack)
 - Pressing Esc will reinitialise the message stack 

 - Default shortcuts can be changed in manifest.json

### Installation

- Clone this repo
- Go to chrome://extensions/ and click on "load unpacked" button and choose path where repo is cloned
